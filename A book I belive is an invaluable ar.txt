A book I belive is an invaluable arsenal. Regarding everything that I design today, 
books have been an inexhaustible source of energy. Some books here form a genre of their 
own and are incapable of fitting neatly into commonly agreed-upon categories. When I look
 at my book collection, every book is indifferent in it's experience yet, each is a crumble 
 of a bigger mass of knowledge. I have chanced upon a bunch of books from the beginnning of 
 my design journey and I restrain myself from framing these into words that are in modern parlance. 
 However, for the importance of relevance, these books are mostly on specifics in design, design 
 thinking, memoir, warcrime  etc.
