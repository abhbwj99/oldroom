            various fields of study such as human sensory actions / reactions, human cognitive studies, 
            which all root from & and are in relation to a broader understanding of what human 
            interaction means in this vast universe.</br></br>This was a group project that underwent extensive research
            on human sensory model - its actions and reactions to outer stimuli, Synesthetics, cognitive studies and a few more.<p>

        <p>After spending a few days delving into the previously mentioned book,
           we reached a thorough and collective comprehension of various philosophical 
           ideologies and their interpretations by others.</br></br> Upon arriving at our ultimate 
           conclusions, we chose to ascribe three distinct words to the ongoing journey of 
           human existence. These words, when used in discussions about life, not only 
           carry their conventional Oxford English definitions but also take on an additional 
           layer of significance.</p>

        <p class="without_body">The experiment sought to investigate the impact of desirability,
             when intertwined with variables like anticipation, stakes, and triggers, on human
             behavior and interaction. Both groups were provided with identical arrangements of PVC pipes.</br></br>
             Their objective was to effectively move the marble from one end of the pipe to the 
             opposite end, depending entirely on their sensory perception and collaborative efforts.

    <p class="with_body">Initially, it was noticed that participants in the room 
        without stakes exhibited a certain level of lethargy and seemed somewhat passive, 
        lacking energy.</br></br>
        However, a significant transformation occurred when stakes were introduced in the 
        form of a Rs 1000/- incentive, with a specific time frame to complete the game. 
        This change in the situation brought about a remarkable shift in their mindset,
         body language, and approach to the task.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="secondstrike">
        <p class="with_body2">The introduction of stakes, along with the anticipation 
            of a reward, served as potent catalysts. It motivated participants to become 
            more proactive, creative, and goal-oriented in their pursuit of victory. 
            This experiment underscores the profound impact that incentives, constraints,
             triggers, and anticipation can exert on human behavior and motivation in 
             the context of interactive design scenarios, highlighting the intricate 
             interplay of psychological and motivational factors.

        This separation was maintained until participants were instructed to enter 
        separate rooms.</br></br>
        Participants without stakes were guided to the negative space, while those

             During the space setup, we thoroughly considered the role of the five human 
             senses and the potential for modifying or introducing external elements to 
             create a multi-sensory experience.

        anticipation which led to an undesired outcome.

        Furthermore, the video employs a poignant visual style to scrutinize the intricate 
        relationship between human development and the natural world. Through artful
        manipulation, it conveys a sense of melancholy, prompting viewers to ponder 
        the complex ramifications of human actions on the environment and society.
