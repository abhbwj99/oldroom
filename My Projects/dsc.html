        <p>A Peek Into the widespread concern of Noise Pollution 
            in today’s world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="nnblank"></div>
    <div class="nblank">
        <p>UNEP’S (United Nations Environment Programme) take on noise pollution
             across the globe.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Noice pollution exists everywhere around us. It is the product of 
            human interaction with the material world. Ranging from vehicluar 
            noise to industrial noise to domestic noise (usually caused by
             usage of Multimedia like TV, Games with unregulated volume levels) 
             can leave a catastrophic impact on human as well as animal life 
             thriving in an ideal urban surrounding. Apart from the domestic 
             occurances of noise pollution, publicly, noise is generated 
             from vehicular congestion on roads (the sounds produced by the 
             some badly maintained engines of heavy vehicles to repetative 
             honking from various vehicles all the same time).<br /><br />
             The human tolarable range to noise is anywhere between 0 - 
             85 decibles. Anything above this can cause various physiological
              and birth related problems among infants. Children thriving on 
              streets that are bustling with constant human activity experience 
              trauma, organ damage and some other specific adverse effects. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content1">
        <p> The use of heavy machinery in industries play a major role in 
            contributing to the already existing noise in an urban city. 
            Lack of maintenance of these machinery, negligence of workers 
            to perform a periodic check are some of the specifics that lead 
            to noise pollution.<br /><br /> 
             To be more specific of the negative effects of noise, 
             I can list downsome of the serious biological issues occuring 
             in human beings.This, to a far extent includes physical and 
             mental effects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="unescoimg">
        <img class="unesco" src="/oldroom/Images/Screenshot 2022-09-14 122755.jpg">
        <p class="underpic">The adverse effects of noise on public health are 
            manifold and are a growing global concern. They cover a broad 
            spectrum of outcomes, ranging from mild and temporary distress 
            to severe and chronic physical impairment.<br /><br />
            Night-time noise disturbs sleep and affects well-being the 
            following day. Estimates suggest that in Europe 22 million 
            and 6.5 million people suffer from chronic noise annoyance 
            and sleep disturbance, respectively.<br /><br />
            The elderly, pregnant woman and shift workers are among those 
            at risk of noise-induced sleep disturbance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="systematic">
        <p class="whohead">Systematic reviews from WHO (The World Health Organization)</p>
        <p class="whobody">The health outcomes include annoyance; cardiovascular and 
            metabolic effects; cognitive impairment; effects on sleep; hearing 
            impairment and tinnitus; adverse birth outcomes; and quality of life, 
            mental health and well-being. The noise sources considered in these reviews 
            include road traffic, railways, aircraft, wind turbines, and leisure 
            activities such as attending sporting or concert events, listening to 
            music through personal devices, and other recreational pastimes</p>
            <p class="howhead">Understanding WHO's human exposure thresholds.</p>
            <p class="howbody">Decibels (dB) are the units of measure for 
                indicating the intensity or loudness of a sound that help 
                predict thresholds that affect human life. Physically, proximity
                 to very loud abrupt sounds, such as a gunshot over 140 dB, could 
                 rupture the ear’s tympanic membrane, causing immediate hearing 
                 loss.<br /><br />
                Listening to music with earphones at the maximum volume – 
                ranging between 90 and 100 dB at the eardrum – could start 
                to cause hearing damage after 
                only 15 minutes per day. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="systemset">
        <p class="ndpara">
            Regular exposure to over 85 dB for an 8-hour day or longer can cause
             permanent hearing damage. Long-term exposures, even at relatively 
             lower noise levels that are common in urban areas, can also damage
              both physical and mental health.<br /><br />
            These are time-averaged noise indicators for the relevant time 
            period, expressed in dB and monitored at the receiving end on the
             most exposed side of a building.

        <p class="forbesind">Forbes India Report<br />"Noise Pollution: When will the government wake up?"</p>
        <p class="forbescontent">In March 2022, newly-appointed Mumbai Police 
            Commissioner Sanjay Pandey invited complaints on his own Whatsapp
             number. Among the first things he discovered was the serious impact 
             of noise pollution on people. Within days of taking office, at his 
             very first weekly Facebook live chat, he announced construction would 
             not be permitted at night and on Sundays.<br /><br />

            In Mumbai, many schools and colleges are placed next to construction 
            sites and other noise sources. In the last two years during Covid-19
             lockdowns and afterwards, ‘work from home’ has become routine and 
             some classes continue to be held online.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="jumper">
        <p class="forbescontent1">In 2018, a complaint from filmmaker Ashwin Nagpal
             told me of “round-the-clock noise pollution which was impacting my 
             sleep, health and ability to work”. I recorded up to 103.4 decibels. 
             On orders of the Bombay High Court, the police verified that decibel 
             levels were excessive at the Metro-3 construction site and the 
             government assured the court that noise would be restricted.<br/><br/>
 
            Three years later, in December 2021, Ashwin Nagpal tweeted to the 
            Mumbai Police: “Loud Metro3 drilling machine been on from 2 am 
            continuously at Churchgate. This is in violation of the Supreme 
            Court order. Don’t citizens have the fundamental right to sleep 
            in peace?”
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="distance">
        <p class="forbescontent2">Noise pollution has been described as the new 
            second-hand smoke.  “The world’s cities must take on the cacophony of 
            noise pollution” says an oped by UNEP Executive Director Inger Anderson 
            in March 2022. “As cities become more crowded, their soundscapes 
            become a global public health menace.”<br /><br />

            Ear-shattering noise levels at construction sites continue to be the 
            norm all over the city. Mumbai aspires to world-class infrastructure 
            and our construction drive is meant to fulfill that dream. Yet, our 
            building techniques are anything but world-class.

            As I started my querey, they had quite a bit to offer. They complained

            the shift in the sensation of the sound starting & ending from either of 
            the two ears) that they experience due to constant movement of

            <br /><br />
            They are also agitated sometimes when multiple customers come in. This, as

            <p class="gmappara">While walking inside the premises, I came across 
              plenty of kids running along the corridors outside their classes. Some 
              kids were having fun in the playground. Apart from the chaos going on 
              inside the premises, there was heavy amounts of clamour, loud mixed 
              sounds of hooters from heavy transports/cars etc which were heard well 
              inside the schools compound.Students outside of their classrooms were well 
              exposed. However, they were not consious of this. </p>

        <p class="centeralign">Noise and its hazard to humans & nature is an indirect 
          consequence born out of the need to consume, establish, publicize and create 
          demand to material goods, services, products etc,. With increase in Air 
          pollution, it is much more favourable for sound waves to travel. Looking 
          at noise as a problem of its own will not suffice. Also, noise is quite a 
          subjective matter; some love listening to heavy music while performing 
          their daily activities, some prefer relatively quiter environment and 
          some overlook or don’t pay attention to the amount of noise they’re 
          subjected to.<br /><br />
          There has been several technological advancements & counter measures for 
          noise cancellation and comeplete sound proofing. Nonetheless, we must not 
          fail to notice that these advancements come with a cost that most cannot 
         afford or simply too irrational for a common man to understand & conform with. 
         <br /><br />
          Reflecting upon how modern day problems are affecting us & our surroundings on 
          a large scale, in which consumtion becomes the fitting equation for all our 
          problems, we must stop & deliberate on solutions that can bring about large 
          scale impact & humble in its propositions. </p>
